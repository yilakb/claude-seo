## Data Handling

Claude SEO is a Claude Code skill that runs entirely on your local machine. The core skill does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data.

## What Stays Local

- All SEO analysis runs in your Claude Code session
- HTML parsing, content analysis, and report generation happen locally
- Generated reports (PDF, HTML, Excel) are saved to your local filesystem
- No telemetry, analytics, or usage tracking

## Extension APIs

Optional extensions make API calls to third-party services when you invoke their commands:

| Extension | Service | Data Sent | Privacy Policy |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **DataForSEO** | api.dataforseo.com | URLs and domains you analyze | [DataForSEO Privacy](https://dataforseo.com/privacy-policy) |
| **Firecrawl** | api.firecrawl.dev | URLs you crawl or scrape | [Firecrawl Privacy](https://www.firecrawl.dev/privacy) |
| **Banana (Gemini)** | generativelanguage.googleapis.com | Image generation prompts | [Google AI Privacy](https://ai.google.dev/terms) |

## Google SEO APIs

When configured with Google API credentials, these scripts transmit data to Google:

| Script | Google API | Data Sent |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| `pagespeed_check.py` | PageSpeed Insights | URL to analyze |
| `gsc_query.py` | Search Console | Authenticated query for your verified properties |
| `gsc_inspect.py` | URL Inspection | URLs to inspect |
| `indexing_notify.py` | Indexing API | URLs to submit for indexing |
| `ga4_report.py` | Analytics Data | Authenticated query for your GA4 properties |
| `crux_history.py` | CrUX History | URL or origin to query |

Google API usage is governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and the [Google API Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms).

## Credentials

- API keys and OAuth tokens are stored locally in `~/.config/claude-seo/` or environment variables
- Credentials are never committed to the repository (blocked by `.gitignore`)
- OAuth tokens use refresh tokens and never store client secrets in token files
